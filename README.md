### Project Description
This project uses computer vision to interpret hand gestures from a webcam feed. It translates specific hand movements into computer actions, such as taking screenshots, simulating mouse clicks, and navigating left and right using keyboard arrows. The system is designed for hands-free control of a computer.

### The Problem statement
1. Changing Slides without using keyboard and mouse
2. Make an assistant for heavily lazy people who cant even move to press the printscreen button
   

### The Solution
Using Computer Vision

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [Languages used] Python
- [Frameworks used] MediaPipe
- [Libraries used] OpenCV, PyAutoGUI,MediaPipe
- [Tools used] VSCode

For Hardware:
- [List main components]
- [List specifications]
- [List tools required]

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
[commands] pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy


# Run
[commands] python printsc.py
           python changeppt.py

### Project Documentation
For Software:
1. Core Functionality:
Screenshot Capture: A specific gesture (typically a widening distance between index and middle finger) triggers a screenshot.
Mouse Click Simulation: A different gesture (typically a narrowing distance between index and middle finger) simulates a mouse click.
Left/Right Arrow Navigation: The horizontal position of the palm relative to the center of the screen controls left and right arrow key presses, allowing for basic screen navigation.

2.Algorithm
Capture a frame from the webcam.
Process the frame using MediaPipe's hand detection model.
Extract relevant landmark coordinates.
Apply algorithms (distance calculations, screen-relative position analysis) to determine gestures.
Based on the determined gesture, execute corresponding actions using PyAutoGUI.
Display the processed video feed with visual feedback (landmarks drawn, distance shown).
